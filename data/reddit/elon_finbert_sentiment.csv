1lu9n7x,2025-07-07,2025-07-07 23:37:21+00:00,Model 3 Feedback,"I have a 2025 model 3, and overall I love this car. It is the best car I’ve ever had by a lot. Just wanted to share a few things that I would fix/improve

1. Sometimes the left and right turn buttons get stuck. I just can’t press them down at all and I have to wait a bit before they are pressable again. Very odd and annoying but doesn’t happen often

2. The charge port often takes multiple presses before it opens and if its plugged in takes multiple presses to unlock the charger cable. I’ll sometimes press the unlock button 2-4 times and go to unplug the charger and it’s still not unlocked this should be fixed asap

3. The sound that plays when the light turns from red to green is not always reliable. There are times when I’m in a left turn lane, the go straight light turns green but the left turn light is still red. However the sound still plays which is incorrect. Hopefully there is some way to make this more accurate and take into account which lane you’re in

4. Since I’ve had the car it has only rerouted me once which saved over ten minutes and that was great. Now of course it is possible that this opportunity has never come up before or since, but maybe there were other chances to save some time and the navigation didn’t reroute me. I don’t know for sure if that was ever the case so this one is dependant on the situation

5. When using FSD, the car should actually go to the top speed that you set. My max is set to 85 but the car will not go above 79/80 even if there is a lot of space in front of me, so i have to keep pressing the accelerator which is annoying 

6. Add an option for pin to drive on the app. This would be useful in case you don’t want people who are in your car to see what your pin is. If I can do it on my phone I can hide my pin from other people.

Of course, a lot is simply unknown to investors outside of Tesla. Here are some choice quotes I found interesting. FT is paywalled but I trust somebody here can figure that out.

>Tesla does not break down its profits from regulatory credits by region, or between the three American programmes. But a person familiar with the matter said that on average as much as three-quarters came from the US, with the remainder from similar systems in the European Union and Asia.

>In the US, there is little hope of reviving US federal emission credits while Trump is in office. But California has sued over the administration’s efforts to shut down its scheme, in which Tesla has by far the biggest balance of credits.

>Beyond selling cars and credits, it also manufactures its own batteries, runs a network of about 2,600 US EV supercharger stations, builds solar roof tiles and commercial and residential battery storage packs. Almost all of those businesses will lose significant federal support or tax relief; only energy storage subsidies remain in place. Particularly damaging will be the removal of a $7,500 federal tax credit for certain EV purchases and leases at the end of September.

Hopefully an investor will ask at the Q2 earnings call what Tesla's projections show for earnings losses. So much uncertainty!",147,0.88,95,teslamotors,https://www.ft.com/content/aaf1a903-1936-4807-9fa0-6fbbe2485edb,/r/teslamotors/comments/1lrmuz4/financial_times_on_bbbtesla_impact/,,neutral,0.907528281211853

1l7rm0h,2025-06-10,2025-06-10 06:20:32+00:00,Tesla versus Waymo: Two Very Different Roads to Full Autonomy.,"🚗 Tesla vs. Waymo: Two Very Different Roads to Full Autonomy 🛣️

Take a look at the illustration below (credit: Chris Philpot, BloombergNEF). It reveals just how differently two leaders in self-driving technology “see” the world:

Tesla vs Waymo
Cameras - 8 vs 14
Radar - 0 vs 6
Lidar - 0 vs 4
Total sensors - 8 vs 24

Key Take-aways

1. Minimalism vs. Redundancy
Tesla bets on an 8-camera, vision-only stack. Waymo layers cameras + radar + LiDAR (24 sensors) for high-confidence perception.


2. Cost & Scalability
Fewer sensors mean lower BOM and easier mass production for Tesla—but also heavier reliance on advanced AI to make up for missing depth data.


3. Edge-Case Handling
Multi-modal sensing (Waymo) can offer robustness in low-light, glare, and inclement weather. Vision-only (Tesla) must solve these purely in software.


4. Compute Requirements
More sensors = richer data = greater processing demands. Waymo’s stack leans on hefty onboard compute; Tesla optimizes around its custom FSD chips and over-the-air neural-network updates.

Which philosophy will win out as we close in on Level 4/5 autonomy— AI-centric minimalism or sensor-fusion redundancy? And how should startups or tier-1 suppliers and OEMs position themselves in this debate?
