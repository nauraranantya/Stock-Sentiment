1lwp0p6,2025-07-10,2025-07-10 21:37:47+00:00,"Tesla moves to expand Robotaxi to Phoenix, following rival Waymo","Elon Musk’s Tesla has applied to test and eventually deploy its Robotaxi vehicles in Phoenix, Arizona, following in the footsteps of market leader Waymo.

Tesla has applied to conduct autonomous vehicle testing and operations, with and without human safety drivers on board, in Arizona, a spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Transportation told CNBC on Thursday. A decision on the application is expected at the end of July, and Tesla has “expressed interest in operating within the Phoenix Metro area,” the spokesperson said via email.

Reuters first reported Tesla’s Arizona ambitions.

The effort to expand to Arizona comes after Tesla in June began a pilot test of its robotaxis in Austin, Texas. Tesla’s Austin fleet includes Model Y SUVs that are equipped with the company’s newest, automated driving systems. Those vehicles are remotely supervised by employees in an undisclosed operations center, and they each include a human safety supervisor who rides with passengers.

The safety supervisor sits in the front passenger seat, accompanying riders, who are invited fans of Tesla. The supervisor can intervene should the Tesla Robotaxis get into trouble.

Waymo, owned by Google parent Alphabet, opened up a driverless robotaxi service to the public in the Phoenix area in 2020.

Tesla, which was once seen as a self-driving pioneer, is now working to catch up to Waymo. The companies have distinct approaches to self-driving technology. Tesla claims its choice to mostly use cameras instead of expensive sensors like lidar will make its autonomous vehicles more economically viable.

The Musk company’s initial efforts in Austin have run into issues.

One invited passenger, who runs a Tesla-focused YouTube channel called Dirty Tesla, captured an incident on camera where his Robotaxi dinged a parked car outside of a restaurant.

Other incidents where Tesla Robotaxis violated rules of the road in Austin have also been captured on camera and circulated on social media, drawing regulatory scrutiny from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the federal vehicle safety agency.

Tesla is scheduled to hold a second-quarter earnings call on July 23, during which executives are expected to discuss the initial Robotaxi pilot.

Separately, Musk on Wednesday said on X that Tesla’s Robotaxi service will expand to the San Francisco Bay Area “probably in a month or two.”

The California Department of Motor Vehicles sued Tesla in 2022 alleging that the company made false claims in marketing and advertising about its vehicles’ self-driving capabilities.

Tesla's Approach: Tesla, led by Elon Musk, is committed to a camera-only (vision-based) system for its self-driving cars, with Musk famously calling LiDAR ""lame."" This approach aims to reduce hardware costs and enable faster scaling. However, early footage from Tesla's robotaxi rollout in Austin shows challenges with complex driving scenarios, raising questions about its ability to achieve Level 4 autonomy.

In contrast, Waymo and Volkswagen + Mobileye are embracing a ""sensor-heavy"" approach, integrating high-resolution LiDAR, radar, and multiple cameras into their robotaxis.

Waymo: Operates fully driverless robotaxis in Phoenix and San Francisco, demonstrating proficiency in complex environments and gaining regulatory and public trust.

Volkswagen + Mobileye: Volkswagen has launched a LiDAR-equipped robotaxi service in Hamburg, collaborating with Mobileye to bring Level 4 autonomous capabilities to its ID. Buzz vehicles. This initiative emphasizes regulatory compliance and long-term infrastructure partnerships, potentially allowing it to scale quickly in Europe.

This highlights a growing performance gap, with LiDAR-based systems proving more reliable in complex environments. This has led to increasing investor scrutiny of Tesla's camera-only strategy, as its autonomous driving ambitions are crucial to its valuation. The success of Tesla's robotaxis will depend on how its competitors accrue real-world mileage and city approvals, which could impact investor confidence if Tesla falls behind.",stocks,Elon,0.023,0.881,0.096,0.9395

It seems the entire world needs satellites in the air for web, government, defense, cellular, etc. Again, not familiar with that world but I don't know that I would have much faith if the idea for massive growth was for humans getting to Mars or other Elon-esque grandiose ideas, but it seems there is a giant backlog for people needing / wanting launches for satellites. Is this the main hope? That they figure out reusable rockets and then can constantly be launching satellites? In my early 30s so this would be a long term hold just to have exposure to the sector.

Possible  that real unemployment numbers are worse than what appears on the surface. Oil prices were expected to significantly soar during the short US/Israel vs Iran conflict, but they spiked far lower than anyone thought for now, may be to test some resistance and to adjust to the recent Opec cartel production boost. Tesla was expected to crash, holding and dancing for now with better than expected Q2 sales in light of brand damage, but brand damage is incurable, and it seems that Elon no longer care.

In my area, there was a strong push for people to lease cars instead of buying them. After their lease term ends, they’re not allowed to buy out the cars (though this might change). Additionally, with the possibility of the house passing the bill and removing tax credits on new and used vehicles, isn’t this number going to significantly change by the fourth quarter? Leases will be done, and will people continue to buy or use Teslas now that it will cost 24% more to buyers? I simply don’t understand how Tesla stock is up. This is probably the worst news to happen to Elon Musk.

Furthermore, people who are leasing will lose out on their credit by September 30th, 2025. Since the credit is spread throughout their lease term, I doubt Tesla will honor this if it’s not manipulation. Alternatively, does hedge funds know that the EV credit rule will be redacted, and thus why the stock is up?

Here's a summary from the internet: 

Tesla is expected to report a decrease in second-quarter vehicle deliveries, with estimates around 400,000 vehicles, a decline from the 440,000 delivered in the same period last year. This anticipated drop is partially attributed to a political backlash against CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration and his controversial political views. In the first quarter, Tesla delivered 336,681 vehicles, a 13% decrease compared to the same period last year, according to CNBC. Production also saw a decline in the first quarter, with 362,615 vehicles produced globally, which was also below analyst expectations. 

Q2 2025 Projections:
Analysts predict Tesla will deliver approximately 400,000 vehicles in Q2 2025, which is a decrease from the 440,000 delivered in Q2 2024. 

Q1 2025 Results:
In Q1 2025, Tesla delivered 336,681 vehicles, a decrease of 13% compared to the 386,810 delivered in Q1 2024. 

Production:
Tesla produced 362,615 vehicles in Q1 2025, including 345,454 Model 3 and Y, and 17,161 units of other models. 

Factors Affecting Deliveries:
The anticipated decline in Q2 deliveries is influenced by a political backlash against Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration and his political views. 

Other factors:
Changes in Model Y production lines across Gigafactories, and the buildup of inventory, especially in China, also contributed to the first quarter results. 

Future Outlook:
Despite the anticipated drop in Q2, Tesla is still expected to offer lower-cost and autonomous vehicles in 2025, which could lead to future growth.   ",stocks,Elon,0.043,0.945,0.012,-0.8312

Reads: The source of the problem believes he will be the source of the solution.

No more comparing Tesla's brand damage issue to Bud Light. This is the equivalent of putting Mulvaney in charge of subsequent clean up job. The thing that amazes me most, is that Elon is completely unaware that the problem is **him**. He blamed Afshar as if he could have done something more, fired him (and the entire PR departement a while back if you remember), then with his planet sized ego, puts himself in charge of the problem he needlessly created. What does he think he is going to do? Convince all of Europe to see things his way and change their entire culture to suit his whack-a-doodle views? In his mind, are they all going to be doing the elbowless waves to idolize him by the end of Q3?

Simultaneously, he is now trying to take on the entire US government by going after both sides of the aisle. At what point does the market realize Elon has completely lost his mind? He is clearly having some sort of delusions about taking over the world. His cult followers that were the only ones allowed to ride in the staged Robotaxi ""launch"" understood their mission from their leader. Unless you want to hear a 15-minute Tesla pump session, just skip to the 18:00 mark on this video when he gets out:

Transcript: ""*I'm feeling pretty bullish. I think I am going to buy the stock. This company is about to take over the world I think...*""

They aren't even being subtle about it anymore. They are just telling people to buy the stock because a few select social media influencers were given highly controlled rides and a clear mission to pump. It all seems so desperate. Elon purchased Twitter to build his influence and I speculate somewhere around 10% of his 221+ million followers have had their brain turned to mush by Grok. That is a lot of people that can pump this meme stock. And they probably do think Elon will take over the world and will put their last pennies into that fantasy. Does anyone think that a staged social media campaign based on pure nonsense is enough to keep this stock in absurd P/E range that it has held in at for such a long time?

At what point is the board of Tesla liable to the shareholders for allowing this sort of behavior to continue? I guess they are all too busy selling their shares as fast as their agreements allow them to. Seriously, does anyone look at the insider trading activity and recent high-level departures of this company as have any doubts as to what is going on inside this rapidly failing company?

Tesla shares tumbled.

“Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. 

“No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE. Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!,” he added.

This comes after Musk slammed the US Senate’s latest version of Trump’s multi-trillion dollar tax bill, warning that the cuts to EV and other clean energy credits would be “incredibly destructive” to the country. Tesla shares slumped 5.8% in European premarket trading on Tradegate.

Tesla has benefitted from a popular $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles that Trump’s bill will eliminate. The automaker is set to release second-quarter sales later this week that will likely show a further slump in demand.

>Uber is in talks with Travis Kalanick, the company’s co-founder who was forced out in a boardroom coup eight years ago this month, to help fund his acquisition of the U.S. subsidiary of a Chinese autonomous vehicle company, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The company, Pony.ai, was founded in Silicon Valley in 2016 but has its main presence in China, and has permits to operate robot taxis and trucks in the United States and China.

>The talks are preliminary, said the people, who were not authorized to speak about the confidential conversations. Mr. Kalanick will run Pony if the deal is completed, they said. It is unclear what role, if any, Uber would take in Pony as an investor.

>Financial details of the potential transaction could not be determined. Pony went public last year in the United States, raising $260 million in a share sale. Its market capitalization stands around $4.5 billion.

>If the deal goes through, Mr. Kalanick, 48, will remain in his day job running CloudKitchens, a virtual restaurant start-up that he founded after leaving Uber in 2017. He would also work more closely with Dara Khosrowshahi, who took over as Uber’s chief executive after Mr. Kalanick’s ouster.

>The discussions are the starkest sign yet that Uber is under pressure from Waymo, the driverless car unit spun out of Google, and other autonomous car services. This month, Tesla also unveiled a limited robot taxi service in Austin, Texas. Over time, these autonomous vehicle services may replace or eat into rides from human drivers. In cities like San Francisco, where robot taxi services are available, the vehicles have become ubiquitous and are popular.

>An Uber spokesman declined to comment on deal talks and said, “Uber has a platform strategy, and we intend to work with multiple players in the U.S. and around the world who can safely bring autonomous technology to the world.”

>Devon Spurgeon, a spokeswoman for Mr. Kalanick, did not immediately have a comment. Pony did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

>When Mr. Kalanick was Uber’s chief executive, the company tried developing autonomous vehicle technology. It then bought Otto, a self-driving trucking start-up run by Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer. Google later sued Mr. Levandowski for theft of trade secrets and sued Uber to bar it from using its self-driving technology.

>Under Mr. Khosrowshahi, Uber has taken a different tack to self-driving cars. The company has struck roughly 18 partnerships with autonomous vehicle companies like Wayve, May Mobility and WeRide to bring pilot programs for driverless car services into Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

>The goal, Mr. Khosrowshahi has said in podcast interviews, has been to put “as many cars on Uber’s network as possible.” He has maintained that while autonomous vehicles are growing steadily, ride-hailing networks will have both human and robot drivers for years.

>Today, Uber both competes and collaborates with Waymo. In Phoenix, riders can order a Waymo car through Uber’s app. In Austin, Waymo’s robot taxis don the Uber logo. But Waymo has also expanded into more cities, potentially biting into Uber’s business. And in San Francisco, Waymo customers are required to use the Waymo app to order rides.

>Uber is also watching Elon Musk, who has promised a wider rollout of Tesla’s self-driving taxis and has declined to team up with Uber.

>Mr. Kalanick has grown interested in robotics over the past year, according to two people who have spoken with him. He has brought robots into some of his CloudKitchens to prepare food for customers and has experimented with automated kitchens building food bowls for delivery. He has also become enamored with robots that traverse streets to deliver food to people.

>Pony.ai has been in a precarious situation. In 2019, President Trump’s first administration passed an executive order aimed at eliminating reliance on Chinese technologies in American services, citing national security concerns.

>This year, the Commerce Department passed a rule that forbids autonomous vehicle software used in the United States to be operated or maintained by any Chinese entity. The department set a deadline for March 2026.

>Pony has prepared its U.S. subsidiary of the business for a sale or spinoff. Its engineers “forked” the source code of its technology in 2022, and the software running on autonomous cars has for the past few years been developed in the United States and not in China, two people familiar with the matter said.

>Apart from Uber, Mr. Kalanick is working with other investors to finance a possible transaction of Pony.

>Mr. Kalanick’s early years at Uber were marked by clashes with regulators and other Silicon Valley executives, led by his pugnacious streak. Despite his reputation - or perhaps because of it - Mr. Kalanick brute-forced Uber into a dominant position in the ride-hailing market and toppled traditional taxi services in the process.

>Since his acrimonious exit from Uber in 2017, Mr. Kalanick has kept a low profile, working on CloudKitchens and quietly investing in other start-ups. Only more recently has he begun reappearing in the public eye, making a guest appearance at the “All-In” podcast’s conference event in Los Angeles last September and at Mr. Trump’s inauguration parties in Washington in January.

>Over the past year, Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Khosrowshahi began speaking more frequently, two people said. They discussed robotics, food delivery and the growth of Uber Eats and CloudKitchens, along with the rise of self-driving cars. Those talks, along with the passage of time, have led to a thawing of the once icy relationship between the two men, the people said.

>

>Sam Altman has made many big claims about what OpenAI will be able to do, including spearheading ultra-expansive data centers and building artificial intelligence that can rival the abilities of Ph.D. holders.

>But he also recently made a significant, yet largely overlooked, assertion. OpenAI is seeking to crack the code for advanced autonomous driving.

>“We have some new technology that could just do self-driving for standard cars way better than any current approach has worked,” Altman said last week on the “Uncapped With Jack Altman” podcast, which his brother hosts. Altman added, “If our A.I. techniques can really go drive a car, that’s pretty cool.”

>The technology is in its early stages - DealBook hears that it involves both OpenAI’s Sora video software and its robotics team - but commercializing it is still a distant goal. An OpenAI spokesman declined to comment.

>That could make Altman even more of a competitor to Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but has since waged war on the company. (A short reminder: Musk has sued to try to stop OpenAI from revamping its corporate structure, and he’s building a direct competitor, xAI, that’s raising - and spending - billions of dollars.)

>Autonomous vehicles are key to Musk’s vision for Tesla, which he increasingly sees as the producer of huge fleets of fully self-driving cars. Tesla is focusing on A.I.-powered vision rather than on the array of sensors like lidar that Waymo, a Google spinoff, uses.

>One big question mark for OpenAI: Where will its systems get their data? Tesla and Waymo have already amassed huge amounts of information and video through their years of driving on the roads.

>That raises the question of whether OpenAI believes in a fundamentally different approach to self-driving tech, one that relies less on real-world data and more on advanced simulation, synthetic data or a breakthrough in “generalizable” A.I. Of note: The company recently collaborated with Applied Intuition, a start-up focused on putting A.I. in cars.

>(OpenAI’s venture arm also invested in Ghost Autonomy, a self-driving start-up, though the business folded last year.)

>“I think he really gets it,” Altman said of President Trump’s approach to A.I. (Altman has forged close ties to the president, including by donating to his inauguration fund and announcing the Stargate data center project at the White House.) “I think he really understands the importance of leadership in this technology.”

>Altman was uncertain about whether the right A.I. regulations would come to pass: “I have become a bit more, jaded isn’t the right word, but it’s something in that direction, about the ability of policymakers to grapple with the speed of technology.”

>Altman played down reports of tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft as they rework their relationship: “Do you believe that, when you read those things?”

I am going to need to see a picture of the passenger side floorboard. If they don't put a physical brake pedal in there like all the drivers ed cars have retrofitted in them, you know the human operator will have something like a game controller or button on them to apply the brakes.

Given that the only people riding in these Roboscams are known Tesler fanboys that were invited because of their past posts on X, I am sure the reviews will be nothing short of fantastic. Here is one I can foresee:

Along with being an actual purpose design and built robotaxi instead of just a Jerrry-rigged older model, it has three things Tesla doesn't:

1. Nine LiDAR sensors (and five radars- so it doesn't crash into things).
2. Space for actual passengers- a key feature to taxis.
3. Level 4 autonomy.

I love the Tesla fan perspective on LiDAR: ""It's expensive"" and ""It's not needed with an AI-driven 100% vision system"". Yeah right. Let's see it work then. We've only been waiting a decade now. If Tesla can solve all of the world's hardest technological problems and are the world's best at manufacturing (as Elon states), then why can't they design and build their own simple LiDAR sensors for their cars? They can't make a better version of the sensor I can buy online for a few hundred bucks that goes into a golf range finder but they are going to make a humanoid robot? One of those things is really hard to do. The other isn't.

Tesla is so far behind in this space. I can't believe there are still enough gullible people still falling for the narrative to pump the stock. Their own internal analysis said this endeavor would lose money. At this point I think there are only three types of people:

1. Aware.
2. Blind Believers (aka- cult members).
3. Traders that are aware of the believers and make money off the stock because of them.",stocks,Elon,0.059,0.868,0.072,0.4433

“Let me correct a misimpression: Eutelsat does not have financial difficulties: No. Eutelsat has a need for financing. There’s a difference,” Fallacher asserted. “We need financing to develop the constellation and continue our growth, which has already started and has been significant, and to conserve this unique strategic capacity.”


“We at Eutelsat provide our OneWeb network in low Earth orbit that is sovereign and European. There is a real appetite for this sovereignty across the industry,” he added.

Indeed, Fallacher emphasised that Eutelsat’s OneWeb mega-constellation is benefitting by being a valid alternate to Elon Musk’s Starlink, noting: “In the world now there are only two broadband [LEO] constellations in service: Starlink and OneWeb. What has happened in Ukraine and the recent statements of Musk, threatening a to stop work on a NASA contract, is an opportunity for us. Here we see what it means that an actor as key as that can threaten to stop service.”

Nevertheless, the need for extra financing is considerable. While there are numerous reports that Eutelsat is looking for around €1.5 billion, this might not be sufficient. It is generally accepted that replenishing the OneWeb fleet of 650 craft will cost much more that €1.5 billion. Then there’s Eutelsat’s commitment to the EU’s IRIS2 constellation which will need an additional €2 billion or so. Additionally, Eutelsat is carrying around €2.7 billion of debt.

There's a lot on the domestic calendar this week. But investors and the world are watching global affairs, too.

Meanwhile, several market-driving events are due in the coming days. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, consumer spending data, and possible news on President Donald Trump's tariffs headline the week. Thursday's Juneteenth holiday will mean a break from trading.

The Fed will hand down another decision on interest rates this week, with a decision scheduled for Wednesday. The coming weekend could see Tesla providing a significant update on the direction of the electric vehicle maker.

Did consumers in May continue to prop up the economy? Tuesday's U.S. retail sales will make it clear whether strong spending levels continued, while housing construction data will provide insight into whether builders are catching up with lagging inventory levels. Investors will continue to watch for trade developments as negotiations continue between U.S. officials and key trading partners.

It’s a light week for corporate earnings, highlighted by expected reports from homebuilder Lennar, accounting firm Accenture, grocery chain Kroger, and online used car seller CarMax.

# Fed Interest-Rate Decision Comes Amid Increasing Pressure for Cuts

Fed officials have said they are keeping rates steady amid a strong labor market as they monitor inflation data for signs that Trump’s tariffs are driving up prices.

But the pressure is on the Federal Reserve after May inflation data came in lower than economists expected. Despite comments from President Donald Trump urging the Fed to make a one-point cut, investors don't expect the central bank to take action when its two-day meeting concludes on Wednesday.

The CME FedWatch Tool, which measures fed funds futures to determine the path of interest rates, indicates that traders overwhelmingly believe that Fed will keep rates at their current levels in June. They also don't expect the central bank to move rates at its late July meeting.

After the meeting concludes on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will provide more insight into the central bank’s view on the economy and interest rates when he takes media questions.

On Tuesday, retail sales figures from May will provide another barometer of the economy's health Consumer spending makes up about two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, housing data will also be scrutinized as affordability issues continue to depress home sales. The latest homebuilder confidence reading on Tuesday will show if construction industry officials see improvements coming in the market, while Wednesday’s housing starts data will indicate whether construction levels are rising amid a need for more housing inventory.

# Tesla Robotaxi Rollout Could Come as Early as Sunday

After months of waiting, investors could soon get a key update from electric vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA). CEO Elon Musk said in a recent social media post that the company could roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, as early as Sunday, June 22. ""We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,"" Musk wrote.

The introduction of the company's robotaxi service could be a key moment for Tesla, which is banking on artificial intelligence (AI) and self-driving vehicles to become the transportation technologies of the future. Tesla is well-positioned to lead the market in the emerging technology, analysts have concluded, with Goldman Sachs writing that the EV maker could have a leg up on the competition through its ability to train self-driving through its AI development and to quickly scale production levels of the technology.

Despite a light corporate earnings schedule this week, investors will still get some expected updates from noteworthy companies.

Lennar’s (LEN) expected report after the bell on Monday follows the homebuilder's warning of weakness in the housing market in the prior quarter.  The scheduled Friday reports from accounting firm Accenture (ACN) and online car seller CarMax (KMX) will be posted in the shadow of both companies' lower-than-expected profits in the prior quarter.

1lalxr5,2025-06-13,2025-06-13 17:32:16+00:00,US to Ease Rules Hindering Tesla’s Self-Driving Cybercab,"Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration is taking steps that would make it easier for automakers to deploy-self driving cars without driver controls, a potential boon to the ambitions of Tesla Inc. and rivals looking to put robotaxis on US roads in the near future.

Current rules require automakers that want to deploy self-driving cars designed without a steering wheel or brake pedals to seek an exemption from federal safety standards that effectively require that new cars have human driving controls. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will “streamline” that exemption process, which under current policy has resulted in lengthy processing times that can last years, the agency said in a letter posted to its website on Friday.

As a result of the changes, NHTSA “anticipates reaching decisions on most exemption requests within months rather than years,” NHTSA Chief Counsel Peter Simshauser said in the letter.

The move takes aim at one of the biggest regulatory hurdles facing Tesla’s plan to field its self-driving Cybercab in large numbers. The vehicle, revealed on a Hollywood studio lot last year, lacks a steering wheel and foot pedals, jeopardizing Tesla’s ability to introduce it without an exemption from the agency.

The vehicle is a key part of Tesla’s push into artificial intelligence and robotics that Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has said are critical to the company’s future.

Tesla’s shares touched a session high and rose 1.5% as of 12:29 p.m. in New York.

Tesla later this month plans to launch its initial robotaxi business in Austin, using self-driving Model Y SUVs overseen by remote operators. The company aims to eventually incorporate the purpose-built Cybercab into its fleet after Tesla begins producing them in large numbers next year.

Musk, who donated more than $250 million to help President Donald Trump’s reelection and until recently had led a sweeping push to slash government spending, has called for a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles.

Members of Trump’s transition team also planned to make creating a regulatory framework for autonomous vehicles a top priority, Bloomberg has reported.",stocks,Elon,0.012,0.892,0.096,0.9774
1lahztb,2025-06-13,2025-06-13 14:54:46+00:00,"Swedish pension fund blacklists Tesla, divests stake","June 13 (AFP) -- Swedish pension fund AP7 said Friday it had blacklisted Tesla over the US company's lack of respect for labour rights in the US, and had sold off its $1.4 billion stake in the US carmaker.
The fund said in a statement that it had decided ""to blacklist Tesla due to verified violations of union rights in the United States.""
""Despite several years of dialogue with Tesla, including shareholder proposals in collaboration with other investors, the company has not taken sufficient measures to address the issues,"" the fund said.
AP7 spokesman Mikael Lindh Hok told AFP the fund had divested its entire stake, worth 13 billion kronor ($1.4 billion), in late May.
He said the stake represented one percent of the fund's total assets.
The electric carmaker has also been involved in a labour dispute with Swedish unions since 2023.
In late October of that year, the metal workers union IF Metall launched a strike against Tesla over its refusal to sign a collective wage agreement, and some 130 mechanics at 10 Tesla repair shops in seven cities walked off the job.
IF Metall then extended the strike to include work on Teslas at other repair shops which served multiple brands.
The strike then grew into a larger conflict between Tesla and almost a dozen unions seeking to protect Sweden's labour model, including postal workers, dock workers and even spreading to neighbouring Nordic countries.
Tesla chief Elon Musk has long rejected calls to allow the company's employees worldwide to unionise.
Musk's close cooperation with US President Donald Trump has also led to calls for boycotts against Tesla.",stocks,Elon,0.071,0.865,0.064,-0.296
